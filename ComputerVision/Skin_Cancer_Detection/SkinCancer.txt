Melanoma is also the deadliest form of skin cancer


The goal of lesion segmentation is to automatically segment the boundaries of potential cancerous
regions from dermoscopic images â€” this challenge lends itself perfectly to instance segmentation
and is the one we will be examining in this case study


Semantic segmentation algorithms have many use cases but are most popularly used in selfdriving
cars where we seek to understand the entire scene that a car camera is looking at.
