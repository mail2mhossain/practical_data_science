In particular, you’ll need to supply the:
• Batch size
• Number of steps per epoch
• Total number of epochs to train for
• Path to the COCO weights file (optional, only supplied when fine-tuning)
• Path to the output snapshot directory to store serialized model weights after each epoch
• And finally, the paths to the training and classes CSV files


Once you have determined your batch size, you need to compute the number of steps per epoch.
This can be done by counting the number of annotations in your retinanet_train.csv file: 

The wc command reveals their are 2,618 lines in the retinanet_train.csv file. Since each
line represents a single annotation, there are thus 2,618 annotations in the file. With a batch size of
four, I can now compute the number of steps per epoch:

2618/2 = 1309
